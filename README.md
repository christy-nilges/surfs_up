# Surfs Up Weather Analysis

## Overview
Review weather patterns in Hawaii in hopes of opening a surf and ice cream shop. This project focused on the weather temperature in June and December to assess whether an ice cream/surf shop would be ideal.

## Results

The following summarizes the weather patterns for June compared to December;

This summary table demonstrates the differing weather patterns for the two months in scope along with;
- Average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees respectively, show a moderate temperature and very little fluctuation between the two periods from an average standpoint.
- The maximum temperatures of 85 (June) and 83 (December) are also remarkable similar.
- The minimum temperature of 56 (December) and 64 (June) show the greatest variance, and reflects a much lower temperature level in December that may not be conducive to ice cream or surfing. However, with standard deviations of 3.25 (June) and 3.74 (December) we would expect a little more variation in the december numbers.

## Summary

Overall the weather in December and June are historically very similar, although December has a wider range of results, with its high being close to June's but its low well below June's.

Additional queries that could be run include: Precipation difference between June and December to determine is one has more rainy weather, as well as a comaparison by weather station, as we may see higher/lower temperatures and precipitation levels at different locations. We would be primarily interested in the weather station closest to our prospective location, which would narrow the results and provide the best data for us to consider.
